# Introvert-quiz

This is my first C++ OOP program and I am still learning. a C++ OOP program that determines whether you are an introvert or an extravert based on a series of questions. The program uses a file called "file.txt" where you can add questions line by line.

To run the program, simply execute the "main.exe" file. You will be presented with a series of questions, and for each question, you can choose from five options: strongly agree, agree, don't know, disagree, and strongly disagree.

At the end of the quiz, the program will display your results and indicate whether you are an introvert or an extravert, along with a percentage score. For example, you might see "You are 80% introverted."

The source code consists of "file.h", "file.cpp", and "main.cpp". Feel free to modify the questions in "file.txt" to customize the quiz to your liking.
How to Run the Program

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
    Run the "main.exe" file to start the quiz.
